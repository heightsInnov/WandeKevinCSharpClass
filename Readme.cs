        DRY => Do not Repaet Yourself

        Object Oriented Programming : The principle states that a programming language or a project is made of 
            objects.
            The objects are made of classes which are also called the building block of an object.
            All files are regarded as a class in OOP and at the same time an object.

        Characteristics of OOP
        => Inheritance: Ability of a child class to take up properties or use existing properties from a parent 
            class. e.g A boy inherits two eyes from the human. A boy inherits the ability to think from a homo-sapien
            class.

            The ':' is used to extend a child class to the parent class
        
        => Encapsulation: It is the art of hiding properties of a class from public access

            Access Modifier: They are used to modify the scope of a particular object.
            - Public : Allows an object to be accessible from all other objects within the project
            - Private : Private objects are only accessible within the defining class
            - Protected : Protected Objects are only accessible within the class and implementing classes
            - Internal : Internal objects are only accessible within the same assembly e.g dlls.
            - Static :

        => Polymorphism: Is simply the ability of an object to take different forms or appear in different forms


        Dot Notation: It is used to access the properties and methods of a class from another class.


        => Abstraction: is the art of hiding important business logic implementations away from the user. 
            It is achieved using Interface and Abstract classes which makes use of the override and overload
            command. 

            //TODO
            Bonus: Webservice vs REST API is a very good example of abstraction
                Webservices exposes the logic
                REST API exposes the data

            - Interface: These are contracts bindings between a class and a fellow implementing class
            - Abstract Classes: These are classes containing one or more abstract methods
