        DRY => Do not Repaet Yourself

        Object Oriented Programming : The principle states that a programming language or a project is made of 
            objects.
            The objects are made of classes which are also called the building block of an object.
            All files are regarded as a class in OOP and at the same time an object.

        Characteristics of OOP
        => Inheritance: Ability of a child class to take up properties or use existing properties from a parent 
            class. e.g A boy inherits two eyes from the human. A boy inherits the ability to think from a homo-sapien
            class.

            The ':' is used to extend a child class to the parent class
        
        => Encapsulation: It is the art of hiding properties of a class from public access

            Access Modifier: They are used to modify the scope of a particular object.
            - Public : Allows an object to be accessible from all other objects within the project
            - Private : Private objects are only accessible within the defining class
            - Protected : Protected Objects are only accessible within the class and implementing classes
            - Internal : Internal objects are only accessible within the same assembly e.g dlls.
            - Static :

        => Polymorphism: Is simply the ability of an object to take different forms or appear in different forms


        Dot Notation: It is used to access the properties and methods of a class from another class.


        => Abstraction: is the art of hiding important business logic implementations away from the user. 
            It is achieved using Interface and Abstract classes which makes use of the override and overload
            command. 

            //TODO
            Bonus: Webservice vs REST API is a very good example of abstraction
                Webservices exposes the logic
                REST API exposes the data

            - Interface: These are contracts bindings between a class and a fellow implementing class
            - Abstract Classes: These are classes containing one or more abstract methods


        =========== Classes ==============
        Objects
        Program files
        Building blocks of Objects

        Classes => Modeled Objects / Model of objects / Object templates

        classes contains attributes and methods.
        Attributes are made of variables;
        while methods describe the functions to be performed or performed by a class.

        What are variables: \
            Something that  changes
            Something that takes different forms
            :=> Variables are dynamic and changeable containers for values.

            Declaring variables:
                variables are declared in different ways, however the shortest variable will contain 
                    1. DataType;
                    2. Variable Name; 
                    3. It is terminated with a semi-colon;

                    e,g: int sum;
                         string firstname;
                         string bankName;
                         decimal PI;
                         boolean isValid;

            On a broader scope, a variable contains;
            1. access modifier which is private by default
            2. Data type
            3. Variable name
            4. optional default value 
            5. semi colon.

            e.g public string bankName = "Union Bank of Nigeria";
                private int age;
                private decimal PI;
                
                volume of air = 22.4dm3
                volume of YewKel air = 25 dm3

        DataTypes: Data types are the grouping of information or data in programming. 
            with Objects been the base type for all data types.
        Examples of DT in C#:
            -> Integers: Numbers (Whole numbers), size : 4 bytes
            -> Boolean : True or False, 1 or 0, size: 2 bytes
            -> Float : 4 byte
            -> Double : 8 byte
            -> Decimal : 16 byte
            -> Char : 'a', 'b', '1', 'y', '@', '!'
            -> Null : void, empty, nothing, abstract,
            -> Long : 8 bytes
            -> Short : 2 bytes
            -> String : Alpha-numeric characters. E.g Texts, mix of numbers and characters or alphabets.
